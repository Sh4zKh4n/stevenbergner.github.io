Data-driven innovations are shaping the way we live today. Visualization is at the interface between computation and people who work with data and algorithms. Targeting practitioners with computing science background, this course is focused on tools and advanced methods with applications including Biomedicine, Science, and Business.

# Reading

Two books, ([Munzner 2014](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/)) and ([Telea 2014](https://owewww.crcpress.com/Data-Visualization-Principles-and-Practice-Second-Edition/Telea/p/book/9781466585263)), are providing basic background to the lectures on design and algorithms, respectively. For specific topics, selected research papers are referred to for further detail, if needed.

# Prerequisites

*Note, Cmpt361 is not a prerequisite for this course, anymore.*

The admission criteria for the graduate program in computing science at SFU are sufficient background for this course.
In particular, programming skills in Python or a C-like language are expected, as well as, basic mathematical skills including linear algebra, and basic statistics. Lab sessions provide tutorials on some of the foundations, including computer graphics.

# Grading and workload

(Tentative, to be discussed in first lecture.)

Assignments in CMPT 767 are due in two to three week intervals, which works out to 4 assignments (HW 1 - 4).
The extra workload for this course is planned around 8-10 h/week including programming and reading tasks.
There is no mid-term, but the final project will divide into proposal + milestones from the middle of the semester towards a final presentation. The assignments are weighted equally and count 50% towards the final grade, where the other 50% are composed of different aspects of the project (implementation + presentation + report).
