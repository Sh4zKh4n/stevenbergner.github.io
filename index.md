# [](#header-1) Research collection

Here you can find some highlights of my work as researcher with active fields of interest in computing science, applied mathematics, statistics, and quantiative finance. Within this broad scope, my topics of focus are in data acquisition and sampling,
feature extraction and classification of multi-dimensional images,
and on visual mappings that facilitate better understanding and control of complex computer codes.
