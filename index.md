## [](#header-1) Research collection

This site is an account of projects and output from my work on various topics in data analysis and modelling
ranging from data acquisition and sampling,
to feature extraction and classification of multi-dimensional images,
to novel visual mappings that help people to better understand and control complex computer codes.
