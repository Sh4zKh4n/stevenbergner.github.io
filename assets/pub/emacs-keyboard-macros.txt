:Intro to Emacs keyboard macros:

C-              prefix to hold ctrl (strg)
M-              prefix to hold meta or alt
S-              prefix to hold shift

C-x C-c         exit emacs
C-g             abort current command prompt

M-x command     enter command (see list below)
TAB             typing command: auto-complete
                text mode: indent line or region
C-h ?           get help on keys, commands, etc.
C-_             undo/redo once or more
C-+             switch redo/undo direction

:Macro recording:

C-x (           start recording keyboard macro
C-x )           stop recording macro
C-x e           execute macro, press e again to repeat
C-<number> ...  perform ... a number of times

Make repeatable macros by ending in the right place for the
next iteration to start. Change text in place or switch cursor to
specially prepared buffers (make buffer **: C-x b ** Ret,
switch: C-x b Ret) or windows (split: C-2 or C-3, switch: C-x o).

:Files, buffers, and windows:

C-x C-f         open file in new buffer in current window
C-x C-s         save current buffer to file
C-x C-w         write file with new name
C-x k           close (kill) current buffer

C-x b name      switch to named or new buffer, show existing with TAB
C-x C-b         show open buffers
C-x 2           split window horizontally
C-x 3           split window vertically
C-x 1           extend window to merge with other window
C-x o           switch focus to other window

:Selection and working with regions:

C-space         set marker, e.g. to start a region selection
M-w             copy region between marker and current cursor position
C-w             cut region (add to regions in kill ring)
M-d             cut word on right
M-backspace     cut word on left
C-k             cut rest of current line (prefix C-<number> cuts more lines)

C-y             paste (yank) region
M-y             switch yanked region to previous one in kill ring
C-x r s [0-9]   save current region to register number
C-x r i [0-9]   paste register of given number

:Search and navigation:

C-s word        incremental search for word
C-r word        reverse incremental word search

C-a, C-e        beginning, end of line (e.g. to end macro at line start)
C-f, C-b        right, left one character
M-f, C-right    right one word
M-b, C-left     left one word
C-up, C-down    up, down to next paragraph or empty line
C-p, C-n        up, down one line
C-v, M-v        scroll down, up a page (know how to undo C-v)

:List of M-x commands and related key commands:

text-mode               basic text editor
hexl-mode               hexadecimal editor
line-number-mode        show line number
column-number-mode      show column number

M-q                     hard wrap lines in current paragraph
M-l                     place current line at center, top, or bottom
M-%                     query repace
M-/                     auto-complete word in text mode
search-forward
replace-string
beginning-of-buffer     if you do not remember the shortcut
end-of-buffer
auto-revert-mode        update buffer, when file changes on disk
package-install         emacs package management
eval-region             execute LISP expression in region (e.g. in ~/.emacs)
